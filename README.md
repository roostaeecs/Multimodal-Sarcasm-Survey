# Multimodal Sarcasm Detection: The Cognitive Era (2024–2025)

This repository hosts the official meta-analysis dataset and resources for the survey paper:
**"From Feature Fusion to Cognitive Reasoning: A Survey of Modern Multimodal Sarcasm Detection"** (2026).

## 📌 Overview
Multimodal Sarcasm Detection (MSD) is transitioning from simple feature fusion to complex cognitive reasoning. This repository provides a systematic categorization of **66 seminal works** published predominantly between 2024 and 2025.

## 📂 Repository Contents
- **`MSD_Survey_Meta_Analysis_2026.csv`**: Structured data including taxonomy classification, backbone architectures, and performance metrics (F1/Accuracy) for all analyzed models.

## 🛠 Usage
This is designed to help researchers:
1. Identify performance plateaus in current MSD benchmarks.
2. Select appropriate backbone architectures for new MSD tasks.
3. Understand the shift from topological reasoning to LLM-based generative reasoning.
